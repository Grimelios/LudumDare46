Game concepts:

- You play as the evil wizard (e.g. Kammy Koopa from Thousand Year Door) as you struggle to recruit talented henchman
  and outwit the hero (maybe you eventually turn to the good side?)

- You play as a detective investigating a series of increasingly complex crimes, using a dynamic, simple, hand-drawn
  art style and with a tone that doesn't take itself too seriously (but can still dial up the drama when needed)

- Text-based adventure game that internally tracks your perceived mental state and alters the world and plot
  accordingly during the playthrough

- Doom-style FPS, but also inspired by Paper Mario (characters to speak with, items to collect, and a modified combat
  system that's real-time, but enemies and bosses react based on timers, incoming damage, and other player actions in
  a way that kinda mimics them taking their turn)
